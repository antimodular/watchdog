Place watchdog folder in same folder as app folder

Task 0:
Open a terminal, then type:
defaults write com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType none  
(If you never want to see the crash report dialogs. log out and in again)

defaults write -g ApplePersistence -bool no 
(prevents apps from reopening after restart)


Task 1: Add your user to the wheel group
Open a terminal, then type:
sudo dscl . append /Groups/wheel GroupMembership admin
(replace USER by your user, like admin)
Restart your session (logoff+login, or reboot)

Task 2: Grant passwordless sudo access to the wheel group
Open a terminal, then log at root with: sudo su -
(keep it open as root to fix things in case of errors)
Make a backup of the original sudoers file:
cp /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.orig
Edit the sudoers file (with great care):
nano -w /etc/sudoers
(uncomment this line by deleting the first "#"):
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
if it is not present just add it to the end of the file

exit nano via control x, then type y, hit enter
Open a new terminal, for testing the change made to the sudoers:
sudo su -
If it doesn't work:
- sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a MYUSERNAME  -t user wheel    will add this user to the wheel group
-  id shows the group
- then restore the sudoers file from its backup.
with cp -f /etc/sudoers.orig /etc/sudoers

Task 3: Install the watchdog script
Open a new (none sudo) terminal window.
Make it executable:
chmod 755 /Applications/of_v0.10.1_osx_release/apps/borderTuner/watchdog/watchdog.sh 
Or
chmod 755   + drag file here

Make any required changes to the script,
then test it manually to make sure it works as expected:
~/bin/watchdog.sh

Task 4: Schedule the watchdog to run every minute via LaunchD

Copy file
watchdog.plist
To folder
 /Users/admin/Library/LaunchAgents/

If folder does not exists create one.

In terminal run:
sudo launchctl load -w /Users/admin/Library/LaunchAgents/watchdog.plist

If ERROR : Path had bad ownership/permissions appears run:
sudo chown root:wheel /Users/admin/Library/LaunchAgents/watchdog.plist 

Now try the load command again
sudo launchctl load -w /Users/admin/Library/LaunchAgents/watchdog.plist

in my case i installed ffmpeg via brew.sh but my app (now running as superuser) crashed because it couldn't find ffmpeg.
also you apps would not show up in the activity monitor, if runs as superuser

That's it!
