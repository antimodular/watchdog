Task 0:
Open a terminal, then type:
defaults write com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType none  
(If you never want to see the crash report dialogs. log out and in again)

defaults write -g ApplePersistence -bool no 
(prevents apps from reopening after restart)


Task 1: Add your user to the wheel group
Open a terminal, then type:
sudo dscl . append /Groups/wheel GroupMembership admin
(replace USER by your user, like admin)
Restart your session (logoff+login, or reboot)

Task 2: Grant passwordless sudo access to the wheel group
Open a terminal, then log at root with: sudo su -
(keep it open as root to fix things in case of errors)
Make a backup of the original sudoers file:
cp /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.orig
Edit the sudoers file (with great care):
nano -w /etc/sudoers
(uncomment this line by deleting the first "#"):
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
if it is not present just add it to the end of the file

exit nano via control x, then type y, hit enter
Open a new terminal, for testing the change made to the sudoers:
sudo su -
If it doesn't work:
- sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a MYUSERNAME  -t user wheel    will add this user to the wheel group
-  id shows the group
- then restore the sudoers file from its backup.
with cp -f /etc/sudoers.orig /etc/sudoers

Task 3: Install the watchdog script
Create a bin folder for the user scripts:
mkdir ~/bin
Copy watchdog.sh to ~/bin
Make it executable:
chmod 755 ~/bin/watchdog.sh
Make any required changes to the script,
then test it manually to make sure it works as expected:
~/bin/watchdog.sh

Task 4: Schedule the watchdog to run every minute

type exit to exit sudo superuser. otherwise the cron job you are going to create will be as superuser. this might cause problems if your restarted apps link to libraries that were only install as admin user.

Create a log folder: mkdir ~/log
Edit your crontab:
EDITOR=nano crontab -e

crontab -e to enter edit mode
press i to allow insert mode
copy past the cron job
press esc to exit insert mode
press captial ZZ to exit crontab
crontab -l to display all cron jobs



i my case i installed ffmpeg via brew.sh but my app (now running as superuser) crashed because it couldn't find ffmpeg.
also you apps would not show up in the activity monitor, if runs as superuser

create cron job as regular admin user
Insert this line:
*/1 * * * * $HOME/bin/watchdog.sh >> $HOME/log/watchdog.log
or like this
*/1 * * * * /Applications/of_v0.10.1_osx_release/apps/matrixRecorder/watchdog/watchdog.sh >> /Applications/of_v0.10.1_osx_release/apps/matrixRecorder/watchdog/log/watchdog.log

*/1 * * * * /Applications/of_v0.10.1_osx_release/apps/voiceBridge/watchdog/watchdog.sh >> /Applications/of_v0.10.1_osx_release/apps/voiceBridge/watchdog/log/watchdog.log

That's it!
